clone repo and start a local server in the repo directory

For example using python 3:
python3 -m http.server 8000

multi.html will display the summary mosaics for the concordances in the repo root.

Additional concordances can be downloaded using the modNLP concordancing software for any corpus you view using the tool.

Alternatively you can format your search results from other tools to match the JSON or concordance format

A python script conc2json.py can be used to convert from concordance lists to JSON for use with Summary Mosaic
